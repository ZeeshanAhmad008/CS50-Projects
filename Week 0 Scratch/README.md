🎮 Catch The Ball
# 📌 Description

Catch The Ball is an interactive Scratch game designed for fun, reflex training, and basic gaming logic demonstration. The goal of the game is simple: move the paddle or character to catch falling balls and score points. Missing a ball reduces your chances of winning.

This project was created to practice game development logic using Scratch, focusing on movement, collision detection, scoring, and user interaction.
